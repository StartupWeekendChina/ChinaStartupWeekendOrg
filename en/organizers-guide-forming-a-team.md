## What Matters in a Team

Just like any startup, forming a strong organizing team is the most important part of planning a Startup Weekend event. It is also very much like choosing a Board of Directors: it’s important that everyone on the team is as enthusiastic about the mission of Startup Weekend as you are (regardless of his or her personal goals), while at the same time having complementary skills and diverse backgrounds and connections.

**Organizer’s Tip**: Diversity should extend to more than just skillsets; try to balance the gender ratio, and have a wide range of ages. The more diversity represented in the team, the easier it will be to reach out to different target groups.

Every organizing team should have at least one member who is closely connected to the local tech (developer and designer) community. As the ‘technical’ audience is traditionally more difficult to reach out to than the non-technical audience (although this varies from city to city), this can be vital to successfully maintaining good attendee balance.


## Finding Co-Organizers

The best organizers are individuals who are well-connected and experienced in event planning. If you’re looking for co-organizers, try reaching out to current and past organizers of events such as TEDx (a large proportion of Startup Weekend Organizers have also organized TEDx events), coordinators of local user groups and meetups (Meetup.com is a great resource.)

Check our the Promotion section for more ideas on groups/channels to target.

## Working Together

The best Organizing teams maximize time and efficiency by distributing the workload evenly across the following planning categories. We suggest you set expectations early on that each Organizer is fully responsible for each category -i.e., there will be no backup plan if he/she doesn’t follow through. This will increase the feeling of ownership and responsibility, leading to higher performance.

* **Development**: Outreach for sponsorship, Speakers, Coaches, and Judges, team delegation, direction
* **Project Management**: Logistics (venue, food supplies etc), managing financial documentation and fund requests
* **Marketing**: Social media, promotional outreach
* **Creative**: Outreach to design community, SWAG, work with marketing on promotional material
* **Technical**: Outreach to local tech community. Website admin, and ticketing page management

It is critical that no single person on the Organizing Team is responsible for all (or too many) key elements of the event planning process. People get sick, and emergencies happen, so other members of the Organizing Team need to be prepared help out in other areas if required.

Organizer’s Tip: Track all organizing progress in the Google Spreadsheet created by SW HQ; this will help keep everyone up to date without having to schedule frequent updates. This spreadsheet will also serve as a helpful record for the next event in your city.
