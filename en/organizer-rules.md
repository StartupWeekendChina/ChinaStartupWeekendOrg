## Organizer Requirements

* You must have attended a Startup Weekend event prior to organizing one of your own.
* Startup Weekend events must be organized by a team. Ideally two lead organizers and three to five other members of the team.
* Lead organizers should be prepared to hand over responsibilities to new organizers after two or three events.
* Startup Weekend Organizers are expected to be living within (or close by) the community in which they plan to organize, unless you have prior approval from your Regional Manager.

## General Event Requirements

* All Startup Weekend events must follow the standard 3-day, weekend-long format.
* All events must be open to the public (exceptions require specific approval from Startup Weekend HQ).
* No legal documentation or contracts of any kind are allowed to be signed at the event.
* You may not Organize a ‘themed’ event without prior authorization from Startup Weekend HQ.
* All Startup Weekend events must have a certified Startup Weekend Facilitator chosen by the SW Regional Manager, and include this expense within the event budget.
* No Startup Weekend event should have more than 125 active participants.
* Only seed-stage ideas (no concrete work done) are allowed to be pitched and worked on at Startup Weekend events.
* All Startup Weekend events must give proper recognition to global as well as local sponsors.
* No cash prizes may be given at a Startup Weekend event. We encourage in-kind prizes (donated co-working space, networking opportunities, travel opportunities, etc.) that directly impact the progress and success of Startup Weekend teams.
* For Themed (Vertical) events, at least one-third of the organizing team should represent that Vertical. (For example, a group of 6 people applying to organize a Startup Weekend Education event should have at least 2 people with a background in education on their team).

## Branding Requirements

* All Startup Weekend events are stand-alone events and cannot be co-branded.
* All Startup Weekend events must be named according to the following standard: Startup Weekend + [City Name]  or [City Name] + Startup Weekend (Note: This requirement does not apply for University, Themed (Vertical) or Corporate Events. Please contact the Startup Weekend team for alternative naming arrangements.)
* All Event Logos, Banners, and Other marketing materials must include the following: 1. The Startup Weekend Beaker Image, and 2. The text: “Powered by Google for Entrepreneurs” (Note: The SW Beaker can be slightly modified/adapted to each Event’s local branding.)


## Website Requirements

* All Startup Weekend Events must have a dedicated website in order to explain the format and purpose of the Event to the public, showcase the Event’s Coaches, Speaker, Judges, and Organizers, and provide proper recognition to the Event Sponsors. All Startup Weekend Event websites must contain:

1. A header/logo that adheres to the Branding & Naming Requirements (listed above)
2. The Event’s Coaches, Speaker, and Panelists
3. The Startup Weekend Global Sponsor Bar
4. A page/section dedicated to on-line ticketing.

IMPORTANT: Unless otherwise agreed, all Organizers must use the Website Template provided by the SW Team, with the URL of [City].startupweekend.org. Once your Application has been approved you’ll be given instructions for setting up and managing the site.

## Financial Requirements

* Monetary compensation for Organizing or Facilitating an event is prohibited. Startup Weekend event funds can not be used to for personal financial gain.
* Revenue from Ticket Sales and Sponsorships must be used to cover basic Event expenses: Food and Drink
Event Supplies | Associated Venue costs (wifi, maintenance, security) | Facilitator Travel and Accommodation (Note: For a more detailed breakdown of typical event expenses, see the Budgeting Section of the Organizer’s Guide.)
* All events must charge for admission.
* All event Organizing teams must have at least one Organizer specifically dedicated to managing the finances and event budget.
* All ticket sales and sponsorships must go through Startup Weekend HQ. Funds will be advanced prior to or reimbursed after the event. (Note: In some instances, sponsorships may be received locally with prior authorization from SW HQ.)
* 50% of all leftover revenue (net profit after the above expenses have been covered) is retained by Startup Weekend, and 50% is reinvested back into the local startup and entrepreneurial ecosystem via the Startup Weekend Community Chest
