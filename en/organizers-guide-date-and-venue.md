Having a date and venue secured is the first major hurdle to Organizing a successful event. It also is the first major validation of your efforts: it’s difficult to proceed with any other aspect of planning until these two key hurdles are overcome. It’s also highly recommended you go tackle these two questions at the same time: choose an ideal set of dates (at least 2-3 weekends), and shop around with potential venues to find a good fit.

## Picking a Date

Picking a good date for your Startup Weekend event is crucial. You don’t want to compete with other events in your city that will attract the same people. Here are our suggestions for picking a date:

* Check local tech and community calendars to make sure you don’t pick a date that conflicts with other popular events
* Be sure to check Meetup.com, Facebook, and other online event sites for related events.
* Check holiday and religious calendars.
* Consider university calendars. Be sure not to schedule the event during exam times or sporting event (especially if your area is known for big tailgating crowds!)
* Finally, Google/Bing search “your city” + “date.”

**Organizer’s Tip**: If you can, try to schedule your event directly after another large entrepreneurship/tech event, and ask that event’s organizer to let you make an announcement for your Startup Weekend.

## Picking a venue 

Picking a venue is one of the first steps in organizing a great Startup Weekend: a poor venue can undermine even the most well-planned of events while a great venue can make a good event great. Below is a checklist of things to consider when looking at possible venues:

Ideal Venues (in order of preference):

* Co-working spaces
* Corporate (or Startup) Office Space
* Universities
* Event Venues & Hotels

**Organizer’s Tip**: With Universities, Event Venues and Hotels, be sure to ask about security fees and catering contracts before signing anything. A ‘free’ venue with a high security fee and/or an exclusivity contract with an expensive catering company can end up costing many thousands of dollars.

## Venue Checklist

* Cost? A venue should be donated in exchange for sponsorship during the event. In some cases, you might have to pay for a venue, but be sure it will fit in the event budget. Also, make sure to verify all venue costs before the event.
* Size? In order to gauge whether a venue is a suitable size, you’ll need to decide on an approximate number of participants. Remember that space requirements vary throughout the event: on Friday and Sunday pitches, you’ll need to accommodate  all participants (plus judges/coaches/special guests, etc.) in one room, while on most of Saturday and Sunday, teams will need to be a bit more spread out.
Location? Try to find a central location that is easily accessible by all attendees, including those that choose to take public transportation.
WiFi? Is there enough bandwidth? A good rule of thumb is to make sure there will be at least one router for every 25 people or 100 Mbps.
* Power? Are there enough power outlets? Will you need to bring in power strips/surge protectors?
* Hours? Make sure you have access to the venue by 4 PM on Friday to give you enough time to setup. Try to get access to the venue until 2 am Friday & Saturday night. Are there any Security officers in the building that you need to know about? Access codes you need to know about? Keys or access cards you must carry with you? Be sure to have the phone number of the person who runs the venue, just in case.
* Tables? Make sure there are enough tables for everyone to work on – visualize the number of teams that will be working and how they will be distributed throughout the space. In addition to those tables make sure there are a few extra long tables for food and registration. You may need to rent tables (in most cities, renting tables is very affordable.)
* Chairs? Are there enough chairs? If not, look into sourcing or renting some extra chairs.
Presentation Room? Is there a common area that will fit everyone for speakers, pitches and presentations?
* Projector & A/V? Does the venue have a projector and A/V System? If not, you will need to source one.
* A/C & Heat? Make sure the venue does not have any automatic timers for heat and A/C. Also it would be good to have access to the A/C and/or heat during the weekend so you can adjust it as needed. Alternatively, get a contact name & telephone number for the contact person who can make those adjustments for you.
* White Boards? Make sure there are plenty of white boards. If not, find some you can use for the weekend. Every team should have either a whiteboard or a flipchart to work with.

(Organizer’s Tip: Rolling whiteboards can serve as effective space barriers between teams, particularly in smaller venues.)

* Parking? Is there enough parking for everyone? Make sure to give attendees information about parking before the event.
* Kitchen Area? Does the venue have a small kitchen area with a sink and refrigerator? Small, but important! If there is no refrigerator at the venue, be sure to have plenty of ice and coolers for drinks.
* Bathrooms? Are there enough bathrooms? One toilet for 100 people will not do. Are the bathrooms automated? Do they lock after normal business hours? If so, make sure you coordinate to have overriding access during the event.
* Security? Some venues have very strict security policies. Make sure to ask about security protocol when you tour the venue (both in terms of areas you can access, and which internet and network points participants can access). If security protocols are strict, ask to make arrangements for temporary access codes or visitor badges.

**Sponsorship Agreements with Venue Providers**

As it’s important to secure a free (donated/sponsored) venue, venue providers will often ask to receive basic sponsorship recognition in return for the use of their space. Typically, the venue provider can be listed as a “Contributing Sponsor”, and treated as a sponsor throughout the event. However, the event cannot be co-branded by the venue (see the Rules & Requirements page for more details.)

**Venue Insurance**

Your event space is covered under the general SW Insurance Policy. Our policy does NOT cover the serving of alcohol or aggressive activities. If your venue host requires proof of insurance, please send an email request to your Regional Operations Manager with the contract from the venue host stating the certification requirement along with the venue contact information.
