The Startup Weekend Organizer’s Guide is designed to be the ultimate resource for helping all Organizers plan their Startup Weekend event. From high-level to nitty-gritty details, we’ve tried to compile and consolidate all our event organizing experience into an easily-navigable and accessible resource. This page (below) serves as a chronological overview of what general things Organizers should be thinking about from 3+ months out up to the day of the event. The bulk of the Guide, however, is broken down in sections based on topic. We suggest new Organizer’s skim through each section, then dive into each section in detail as you tackle the topic.
